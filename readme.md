# Dev.to Clone

This is a simple frontend clone of Dev.To for teaching purposes.

It uses PHP, HTML and CSS but no database (yet).


## Setup

We have implemented a rudimentary database.

To set up the database, you will need to execute the *db/example-data.sql* file (copy and paste it into mySQL as a root user).

You will also need to create a DB user for the app with appropriate privileges.

Finally, add the necessary configuration into *config.ini* matching your credentials and database configuration.

The seed articles should load into the *main.php* page.
